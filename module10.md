### Next Steps
Now that you've got a basic app up and running you may be looking for additional information on where to proceed. 
  
### Testing, Profiling
You'll want to find tools for helping you test and debug your apps. You should also look at using a tool to measure performance metrics. Here are some
links to tools and resources that can help you further:

  - [browser-perf](https://github.com/axemclion/browser-perf) - a node based tool that measures various performance metrics of a web page or hybrid application 
  via the browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE)
  - [Remote Debugging on Android](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-android/)
  - [Debugging with Safari Web Inspector](http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/debugging-ios-phonegap-apps-with-safaris-web-inspector.html)

### Securing your App

### Adding Analytics
Analytics can be used to determine how your app is being used, which features are popular and where your pain points are.  
    
-[Adding Analytics to your PhoneGap Apps](http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/08/18/adding-analytics-to-your-phonegap-app/)
    
### App Submission (provisioning, code signing, submitting to app stores)
- Check out this [useful guide to App Submission](https://github.com/timkim/phonegap-day-workshop-app-submission/wiki) built by the PhoneGap Team.  

### Updating your App
Update your apps in the iOS App Store quickly without waiting on long approval processes using over the air updates. Use the following
  links as potential resources:

- [Code Push Plugin (using MS CodePush Service)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-code-push)
- [Hot Code Cordova Push Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-code-push) and [associated CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-hot-code-push-cli)     
- Learn how [exFM](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/04/23/story-behind-exfm/) did it. (read the section titled *Loading Assets*).        
- [Ionic Deploy](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/deploy-from-scratch) service
  
### A/B Testing
Experiment with your app and see what works best. Change colors, layout, images, marketing copy or whatever you want to test to 
  understand the impact of the change by using an A/B testing service. 
  
Below are some plugins for services supporting PhoneGap apps:  
  
- [Optimizely Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/optimizely/optimizely-cordova-plugin)
- [Leanplum Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/Leanplum/blob/master/doc/index.md)

### Push Notification Support
Push notifications are a common requirement when developing mobile apps. See the links below for help implementing them in your PhoneGap apps.
