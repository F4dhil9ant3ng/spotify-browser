### Next Steps

Now that you've got a basic app up and running you may be looking for additional information on where to proceed. 
  
### Testing, Profiling
You'll want to find tools for helping you test and debug your apps. You should also look at using a tool to measure performance metrics. Here are some
links to tools and resources that can help you further:

  - [browser-perf](https://github.com/axemclion/browser-perf) - a node based tool that measures various performance metrics of a web page or hybrid application 
  via the browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE)
  - [Remote Debugging on Android](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-android/)
  - [Debugging with Safari Web Inspector](http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/debugging-ios-phonegap-apps-with-safaris-web-inspector.html)

### Push Notification Support
Push notifications are a common requirement when developing mobile apps. See the links below for help implementing them in your PhoneGap apps:
  - Simon's Workshop 
  
### Plugin Development  
There are a vast number of plugins currently available for Cordova but you still may find yourself needing a specific native feature that is not already
  supported. Learn how to write your own plugin below:
  
  - Jesse's Workshop

### Adding Analytics
Analytics can be used to determine how your app is being used, which features are popular and where your pain points are.

### App Submission (provisioning, code signing, submitting to app stores)
  - Go to the workshop today (or watch the recorded video)

### Updating your App
Update your apps in the iOS App Store quickly without waiting on long approval processes using over the air updates. Use the following
  links as potential resources:
     
 - Learn how [exFM](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/04/23/story-behind-exfm/) did it. (read the section titled *Loading Assets*).        
 - [cordova-live-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-live-update)
 - [Ionic Deploy](http://docs.ionic.io/docs/deploy-from-scratch) service
  
### A/B  Testing
Experiment with your app and see what works best. Change colors, layout, images, marketing copy or whatever you want to test to 
  understand the impact of the change by using an A/B testing service. 
  
  Below are some plugins for services supporting PhoneGap apps:
